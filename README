========================================================================

This is a small, fast and easy to deploy library to simulate decoding of
LDPC codes over the Binary Erasure Channel written using Cython and C.
Simulation is done using the zero codeword. An example of how to call the
library is provided in "test.py" and a (3,6) regular Gallager code is 
provided in the file "gallager_regular", which is also indicative of the
format for the code file.

To compile, use the makefile by running make. The resulting LDPC.so file
needs to be in the same directory as a python script importing from the
module "LDPC".
